## Installation
- Click the green "Code" button
- Click "Download ZIP"
- Take the folder from inside the .zip file and move it inside your Figura avatars folder
- Profit

## Customization
- The image can be easily swapped out as long as it has the same name ("texture.png")
- Sounds can go in the "sounds" folder and are accessed via the action wheel (technically you can place them in the root folder as well).
  - **WARNING:** Sounds must all mono and NOT stereo or they will be played for everyone all across the world! This will probably piss them off and lead to your avatar being blocked.
- The size it renders can be modified via variables at line 9 (renderSizeX, renderSizeY).

## Copyright
- The default texture and sound are both modified versions of assets from the roblox game "nico's nextbots."
- The default texture (a nextbot commonly known as "Angry Munci") is a resized version of the original texture taken from "nico's nextbots." All rights to to the "nico's nextbots" developers and the creators of the original image.
- The sound "chase" is a heavily trimmed version of the "nico's nextbots" track of the same name. All rights go to nicopatty.
